Mass transit is a crucial piece of modern urban life.
It reduces the number of cars on the road, which cuts down on traffic jams,
lowers people's stress on both ends of the workday,
burns less fuel than hundreds or thousands of cars,
and is potentially far cheaper for everyone than individual cars.
Public transit also opens up economic opportunities for those who can't afford their own cars.

Unfortunately, some areas that are clear candidates for effective mass transit
are left out, forcing residents to drive or use ride-sharing to get to work.
Whether by choice or simply by accidental omission, this creates a disconnect
between places whose economic activity should be inseparable.

Transit Trailblazer aims to change this in two easy steps:

- Survey residents for insights into their daily travel needs
- Automatically recommend possible transit routes

This is designed to be a living application, with an extensible design
to allow planners to incorporate more data and real maps.

Naturally, an app cannot solve the legal and political problems
so often associated with mass transit, but it can at least
help to provide a clearer picture of what could be done.

Transit Trailblazer is powered by StreamLit and MongoDB.
